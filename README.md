# iGEM 2026 TU Delft — ELP Simulations

CALVADOS / OpenMM simulations of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs).

## Setup

This project is managed with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Install it
by following the [official instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/),
then clone the repo and run `uv sync`.

### Personal machine

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Delft-iGEM/ELP-Simulations.git
cd ELP-Simulations
uv sync
```

In VSCode, select `.venv/bin/python` as your interpreter. From a terminal,
activate the env with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### DelftBlue

Install `uv` once on a login node by following the
[official instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Then add the following to your `~/.bashrc` to redirect `uv`'s caches off the
small `/home` quota:

```bash
export UV_CACHE_DIR=/scratch/$USER/.uv-cache
export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=/scratch/$USER/.uv-python
mkdir -p "$UV_CACHE_DIR" "$UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Reload your shell (`source ~/.bashrc`), then clone the repo to `/scratch`
and sync. This must be done **from a login node** — compute nodes have no
internet access:

```bash
cd /scratch/$USER
git clone git@github.com:Delft-iGEM/ELP-Simulations.git
cd ELP-Simulations
uv sync --frozen
```

## Writing simulations

The simulations use [CALVADOS](https://github.com/KULL-Centre/CALVADOS) on
top of OpenMM. If you haven't worked with CALVADOS before, skim the examples
in their repo first.

To create a new simulation, copy an existing folder under `simulations/`
and rename it. The folder name should match `sim_name` and be descriptive —
e.g. `i70-surfaceattached` for 70 `VPGIG` repeats, surface-attached. You can
use `tools.elibpy.humanize_seq` for naming inspiration.

Inside the simulation folder, `prepare.py` defines the usual CALVADOS
`Config` and `Components` setup; edit parameters there. ELP sequences can
be built with:

```python
from tools.elibpy import build_sequence_with_features
```

You don't have to use `elibpy` — plain strings in the `sequences` dict
work fine too.

For anything that needs to happen on the OpenMM `System` itself (custom
restraints, extra forces, etc.), use the `build_sim` hook in `prepare.py`.
It runs after `sim.build_system()` and before `sim.simulate()`, so the
system exists and is ready to be modified.

The `runtime/` folder is generated and not committed. You **should NOT**
need to edit anything inside it by hand: `prepare.py` regenerates it
idempotently, so running prepare on any machine produces the exact same result.

## Preparing and running simulations

Generate the `runtime/` folder for a simulation with:

```bash
python -m simulations.i70-surfaceattached.prepare
```

This writes `runtime/run.py` along with all input files needed to launch the
simulation. Run it locally with:

```bash
python -m simulations.i70-surfaceattached.runtime.run
```

or submit it on DelftBlue with a SLURM script that calls the same `run.py`:

```bash
cd /scratch/$USER/ELP-Simulations
sbatch simulations/i70-surfaceattached/runtime/job.sh
```
